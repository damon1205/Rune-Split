# Rune-Split-PSBT

In generally to send rune, users have to split their rune tokens through special platform.
This is very inconvenient some times.
So this time, I tried to generate psbt to split rune in our platform.
If you have a questions about understanding my code, feel free to contact me.

Thanks.

In this project, I create the functions to get BTC utxos, and get Rune utxos, get feeRate and calc the total fee.

If my code is helpfull for the bitcoin beginners, then it would be great.
